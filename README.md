# CS542-Simulator-Link-State-Routing-Protocol
The goal of this project to develop a simulator to implement Link-State Routing Protocol which shows following functionalities:
•	Creating a network topology.
•	Simulate the process of generating connection table for each router in a given network.
•	Computing optimal path with least cost between any two specific routers.
•	Modify a network topology.
•	Finding best router for broadcast.
•	Adding router in a network topology.
